This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of a phased array system used for direction estimation of incoming signals.

The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy and reliability of Towed array SONAR systems direction estimations by estimating the locations of the array elements and utilizing linear regression as a data-driven approach.

The project aims to use data from previously measured incoming waves generated by known sources to estimate the locations of array elements based on received incoming signals from an unknown source.
These location estimations are then used to adjust a phased array incoming wave direction estimator, improving its accuracy and capabilities.

A simulation environment was developed using MATLAB to facilitate the analysis and evaluation of various aspects related to acoustic waves and phased array.
Simulations were conducted to investigate different acoustic wave scenarios using Henkel functions (see “Sources”, “Slits”).
Further simulations were carried out on TAS arrays and the impact of deviations in the locations of the array elements on determining the angle of arrival of incoming waves using phased array (see “Phased Arrays”).
An “Average estimator” is then used to estimate the locations of the array elements through the measurements of multiple incoming plane waves transmitted from different angles (see “AVG_Estimator”).
Finally, the project leverages linear regression as a data-driven technique to enhance the accuracy of angle estimation in the phased array system (see “Final”).

To assess the improvement achieved, error for each method was calculated based on measurement noise, element position deviations, and array curvature. (see “error_noise”, “error_dev”, “error_curve”).
